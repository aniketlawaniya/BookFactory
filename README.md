# BookFactory

BookFactory is an e-commerce backend repository built for a book website catering to avid readers. It provides essential features such as a home page, product listing page, single product page, filters by price, category, and ratings, wishlist and cart management, search functionality, alerts, authentication (sign-up, login, logout), address management, and checkout. The frontend is developed using React JS, utilizing useContext and useReducer for state management, React Router v6 for routing, Vanilla CSS for styling, and various libraries like React Icons and React Hot Toast. The backend employs mockBee, a mock API service, for simulating the backend functionality. With BookFactory, users can seamlessly browse and purchase books, manage their wishlist and cart, and enjoy a smooth shopping experience.
